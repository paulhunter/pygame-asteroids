# README 

## Summary
This project is built on [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/about) and inspired by the [Build Asteroids](https://www.boot.dev/lessons/5be3e3bd-efb5-4664-a9e9-7111be783271) guided project on [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/tracks/backend).

After completing the lessons of a project I have further enriched the game with 
features, optimizations, and additional gameplay aspects - some of which will be 
discussed below in this README.

## How to run this project

This project uses Python 3, Python Virtual Environments, and the Package Installer for Python, PIP
